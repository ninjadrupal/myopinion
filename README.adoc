= ðŸ’¡ What is My Opinion?

{uri-website}[MyOpinion] is a participatory democracy  and drupal distribution, it brings collaborative decision making and easy governance to communities and organisations of all sizes .
With the tool, citizens can build proposals, from scratch or by branching from others and decision-makers build two way-conversations with their constituencies. 
Debates take place with the platform rewarding the best arguments, filtering the noise and keeping the trolls at bay. Then people can vote for or against the proposal.
